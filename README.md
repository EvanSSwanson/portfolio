# Abstract
Welcome to my portfolio! This was perhaps the most styling-heavy, JS-weak app I've ever deployed.. and it was pretty fun. I spent more time designing pictures, asking AI to generate pictures, or deliberating over color palettes than actually typing up code. 

Despite Turing teaching me the joys of React Router, I've been on a one-page-when-possible kick recently, thus this app is simple and single-paged by design. If you couldn't tell, I'm a fan of vaporwave/retro-adjacent aesthetics.

In the future, I plan on making the styles look acceptable on mobile screens and making the code a little more professional by employing some free/very-cheap backend hosting option (PocketBase-PocketHost?). However, I really just wanted to get this into the world ASAP.
